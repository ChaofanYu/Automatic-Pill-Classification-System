1. Implemented SOBEL Filter function in Matlab to detect pill edges in pictures which were
captured by OV7670 camera model and extracted features of pills using OpenCV functions.
2. Built classification models(KNN, Nave Bayes, DT, SVM) with 516 features to predict the
category of pills with about 97.77% accuracy.
